","2024 marks a significant milestone for MINI, as the British brand is set to unveil its latest range of vehicles following years of minor updates. Leading the charge is the all-new 2025 MINI Countryman John Cooper Works, which is not only larger but also more powerful than its predecessors. The Countryman has emerged as MINI’s top-selling model in the United States in recent years, owing to its status as the most spacious and largest option in the MINI lineup. But the new U25 Countryman family elevates size to new heights.

","BMW has initiated a recall affecting nearly 79,670 vehicles from its 2023 and 2024 lineup due to a flaw in the ABS and stability control systems. The issue stems from a flaw in the vehicle’s electronically managed integrated braking system, which could lead to a loss of power braking assist, antilock braking (ABS), and dynamic stability control (DSC). While drivers will retain the ability to halt the vehicle through mechanical braking, this will necessitate greater effort and a longer stopping distance. A failure in the ABS or DSC systems may compromise the driver’s control over the vehicle during urgent maneuvers, elevating the likelihood of an accident. Should there be a malfunction in the integrated braking system, a warning indicator will illuminate on the dashboard.",https://www.bmwblog.com/2024/02/22/bmw-issues-a-recall-for-79670-vehicles/,https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2024-BMW-X5-M60i-Ruby-Red-18-830x554.jpg,Horatiu Boeriu,2024-02-22 19:24:13+00:00,"News, BMW recalls, recalls",,,FALSE,2024-02-26 01:15:56.161685+00:00,,
